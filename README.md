📊 Data Cleaning & SQL Analysis Project
📌 Overview
This project demonstrates a practical data analytics workflow where raw data is first cleaned and prepared using Python, and then analyzed using SQL to extract meaningful business insights.
The objective of this project is to showcase hands-on skills in data cleaning, SQL querying, and analytical thinking, which are essential for Data Analyst and Analytics Engineer roles.

🔍 Project Workflow
1️⃣ Data Loading
•	Loaded raw CSV data into Python using Pandas
•	Performed initial inspection (head, info, describe)
________________________________________
2️⃣ Data Cleaning (Python)
Performed comprehensive data cleaning including:
•	Handling missing values (median / mode imputation)
•	Removing duplicate records
•	Standardizing column names
•	Fixing data types
•	Validating data consistency
Cleaned data was then exported for SQL analysis.
